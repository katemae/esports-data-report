## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
League of Legends is a game with an extremely diverse cast of characters, each with their own strengths. Some have very high damage, but lack defenses. Some don't deal as much damage, but are very durable and have a variety of disruption tools. Certain champions have characteristics that make them very strong when played in a coordinated team setting. For example, Jinx can output a massive amount of damage from a long distance, but she often requires her teammates to protect her since she can be killed very quickly. Such champions are picked very often by professional players, who can rely on their teammates to coordinate with them.


One of these champions that is picked rather often in professional play is Renekton. With his great early game strength, high mobility, and a reliable immobilization tool, Renekton is a champion that many players have come to think of as a "pro play champion", that is, one can expect to see Renekton fairly often when watching professional games.


A somewhat popular joke among League players is that champions that such "pro play champions" are often buffed, or made stronger, in the patches leading up to the World Championships in the late fall. This idea stems from the idea that Riot Games (the publishers and developers of League of Legends) would want to buff champions that people are expecting to see at the World Championships, thus leading to a more engaging experience and increased viewership. In this project, we will examine whether this sentiment is true with regards to Renekton in 2022.
